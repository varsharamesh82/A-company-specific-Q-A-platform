# A-company-specific-Q-A-platform

## About the project

In our project, we are building a portal for the employees within a particu- lar company to be able to connect to one another irrespective of being from the same team/branch. An employee can post a query and he/she can discuss the queries and come to a conclusion for that particular problem where another employee may be able to solve his doubt. The employee can look at his/her feed and see the ongoing doubts and can gain more input and can answer others queries if he knows the answer to it. The doubts which are posted are sorted based on date and time, and hence it will be easier for a new person to update himself with the series of answers posted for a single query . To make the project more user friendly, the employee can bookmark questions to use it for his reference in the future.
The need for increased productivity in the tech scene has very recently caught on with several companies building solutions around this (ex: Teams, Slack, StackOverflow Enterprise etc.) Hence, we think building a smart and innovate discussion / Q & A portal will be a very useful project
